**Brain Tumor Detection** is a critical task in medical imaging that involves identifying abnormal growths in brain tissue using techniques like MRI scans. Early and accurate detection is vital for effective treatment and improving survival rates. Machine learning and deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have become popular tools for automating this process. These models analyze complex patterns in MRI images to classify tumors as benign or malignant. Combining AI techniques with traditional medical expertise enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces human error, and enables timely interventions for patients.
